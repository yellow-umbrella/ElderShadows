  description: 'Mavkas usually form from the souls of dead girls. They remember nothing
    from their life but still have longing for love. It is the reason why adult mavkas
    try to seduce men. But they usually end up luring them into a dense forest and
    killing them.


    Mavkas like to play with each other, dance and sing songs
    together. They look like beautiful young girls with hair of different colors.
    Mavkas usually wear white dresses and wreaths from forest flowers. The most expressive
    feature distinguishing them from humans is their torn back so that you can see
    their ribs, guts and heart.'
