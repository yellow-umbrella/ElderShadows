  description: Poterchas are children, that died shortly after birth. Such children
    turn into evil spirits only if they aren`t given a name before their death. Poterchas
    intentionally harm people and can lure them into swamps or deep water at night.
    They look like children in white robes with empty, dead eyes and hold flames
    in their hands. Also, poterchas can turn themselves into lights.
